# Music Visualizer with Autonomous Line Following

This project was developed as part of the Embedded Systems Design course at the University of Michigan. It integrates digital signal processing (DSP) for real-time music visualization with autonomous robotic navigation using a Zumo robot and STM32 microcontroller.

## Features

- Autonomous line-following robot using QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array
- Wireless communication between devices using XBee modules
- H-Bridge motor control for differential drive
- PWM, GPIO, and timer-based driver development

## Technologies Used

- C Embedded Programming
- STM32 Nucleo board
- QTR-8RC reflectance sensors
- XBee wireless modules (UART)
- H-Bridge motor driver
- Zumo Robot
- STM32CubeIDE and HAL libraries
